# Flying minigame

This project consists of a flying minigame styled in the classic "Asteroid" game style. I made this minigame as a school project for my development courses to practice using Javascript.




## Demo

## Improve

- Flying mechanism to mimic that of original game.

- Colliding asteroids that you can shoot down.

- Scoring system.


## Bugs

- Upon first movement ship jumps to left or top side of  the screen. This is due to starting position being calculated in % and movement in pixels.
